@par Example Description 

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by means of the 
HAL API. The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) calculation unit computes 7-bit long 
CRC codes derived from buffers of 8-bit data (bytes).
The user-defined generating polynomial is manually set to 0x65 that is 
X^7 + X^6 + X^5 + X^2 + 1, used in Train Communication Network, IEC 60870-5[17]. 

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK).

The CRC peripheral configuration is ensured by HAL_CRC_Init() function.
The latter is calling HAL_CRC_MspInit() function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed CRC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK). 
You can update HAL_CRC_Init() input parameters to change the CRC configuration.

In this example, the user-defined generating polynomial is configured by 
HAL_CRC_Init(). At the same time, it is set that neither input or output data 
must be reversed, the default init value is used and it is specified that input 
data type is byte.

First, a 5-byte long buffer is processed to yield a first CRC.

Next, a second CRC is computed from a 17-byte long buffer. For the latter,
the CRC calculator is not re-initialized and instead the previously computed CRC 
is used as initial value.

Then, a third CRC is computed from a 1-byte long buffer. Again, the CRC calculator 
is not re-initialized, the previously computed CRC is used as initial value.

Finally, a fourth CRC is computed from a 2-byte long buffer. This time, the CRC 
calculator is re-initialized with the IP default value that is 0x7F for a 7-bit CRC.
This is done with a call to HAL_CRC_Calculate() instead of HAL_CRC_Accumulate().  

Each time, the calculated CRC code is stored in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, the CRC value (uwCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value.

STM32 board LED is used to monitor the example status:
  - LED2 is ON when the correct CRC value is calculated
  - LED2 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period) when there is an error in initialization or if an incorrect CRC value is calculated.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

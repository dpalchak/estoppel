@par Demo Description

This directory contains the binary file (*.hex) of the STM32L476RG-Nucleo
Demonstration firmware.
You can use any in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration
using these binary files, as described below:

 + Using "in-system programming tool" such as ST-Link Utility
    - Connect the NUCLEO-L476RG board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B'
      cable through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Make sure that the embedded ST-LINK/V2 is configured for in-system programming
      (Both CN2 jumpers ON)
    - Use "STM32CubeL4_Demo_STM32L476RG_Nucleo.hex" binary with your preferred
      in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration firmware
      (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).

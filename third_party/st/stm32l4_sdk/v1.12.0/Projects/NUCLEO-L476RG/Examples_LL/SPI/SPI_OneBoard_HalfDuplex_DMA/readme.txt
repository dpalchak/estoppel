@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure GPIO and SPI peripherals to transmit
bytes from an SPI Master device to an SPI Slave device in DMA mode. The example
is based on the STM32L4xx SPI LL API. The peripheral initialization is done using 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

This example works with only one NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C.

SPI1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode Half-Duplex Tx.
SPI3 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode Half-Duplex Rx.
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

Example execution:

LED2 is blinking Fast (200ms) and wait User push-button action.
Press User push-button on BOARD start a Half-Duplex communication through DMA.
On MASTER side (SPI1), Clock will be generated on SCK line, Transmission done on MOSI Line.
On SLAVE side (SPI3) reception is done through the MISO Line.

LED2 is On if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED2 is blinking Slowly (1s).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C Set-up
    - Connect Master SCK  PB3 to Slave SCK  PC10
    - Connect Master MOSI PB5 to Slave MISO PC11

Relation with Board connector:
  PB3  is connected to pin 31 of CN10 connector
  PB5  is connected to pin 29 of CN10 connector
  PC10 is connected to pin 1 of CN7 connector
  PC11 is connected to pin 2 of CN7 connector

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to use DMA with TIMER update request
to transfer Data from memory to TIMER Capture Compare Register 3 (TIMx_CCR3); 
Example using the STM32L4xx TIM LL API, 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

The following configuration values are used in this example:
  - TIM1CLK = SystemClock
  - Counter repetition = 3 
  - Prescaler = 0 
  - TIM1 counter clock = SystemClock
  - SystemCoreClock is set to 80 MHz for STM32L4xx Devices.

The objective is to configure TIM1 channel 3 to generate PWM edge aligned 
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz, and a variable duty cycle that
is changed by the DMA after a specific number of Update DMA request.

The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM1 Repetition counter,
each 4 Update Requests, the TIM1 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
value defined by the aCCValue_Buffer.

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

Whenever a DMA transfer fails LED2 flashes with a frequency of 1 Hz.
 
@note PWM signal frequency value mentioned above is theoretical (obtained when
      the system clock frequency is exactly 80 MHz). Since the generated system
      clock frequency may vary from one board to another observed PWM signal
      frequency might be slightly different.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C Set-up
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH3  PA.10: connected to pin 33 of CN10 connector 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

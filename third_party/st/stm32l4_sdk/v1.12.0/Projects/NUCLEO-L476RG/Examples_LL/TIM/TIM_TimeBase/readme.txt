@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate a time base; 
Example using the STM32L4xx TIM LL API, 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

   In this example TIM1 input clock TIM1CLK is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2),   
   since APB2 pre-scaler is equal to 1.                                     
      TIM1CLK = PCLK2                                                       
      PCLK2 = HCLK                                                          
      => TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock (80 MHz)                                 

To set the TIM1 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 80 MHz for STM32L4xx Devices.

The auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 100ms,
meaning that initial time base frequency is 10 Hz.
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / 10) - 1

Update interrupts are enabled. Within the update interrupt service routine pin PA.05
(connected to LED2 on board NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C) is toggled.

User push-button can be used to modify the time base period from 100 ms
to 1 s in 100 ms steps. To do so, every time User push-button is pressed, the
autoreload register (ARR) is updated. In up-counting update event is generated 
at each counter overflow (when the counter reaches the auto-reload value). 

Finally the time base frequency is calculated as follows:
time base frequency = TIM1 counter clock /((PSC + 1)*(ARR + 1)*(RCR + 1))

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

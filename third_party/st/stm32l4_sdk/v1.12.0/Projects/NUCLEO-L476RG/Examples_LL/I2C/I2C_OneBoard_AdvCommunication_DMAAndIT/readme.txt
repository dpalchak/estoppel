@par Example Description

This example describes how to exchange data between an I2C Master device in DMA mode and
an I2C Slave device in Interrupt mode. The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary
services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO, DMA and I2C peripherals using only one NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C.

I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C3 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with DMA (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED2 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a write request by Master through Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() or 
through Handle_I2C_Master_TransmitReceive() routine depends on Command Code type.

Command code type is decomposed in two categories :
1- Action Command code
    a. Type of command which need an action from Slave Device without send any specific anwser)
    b. I2C sequence is composed like that :
     _____________________________________________________________________________________
    |_START_|_Slave_Address_|_Wr_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_1_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_2_|_A_|....
     ________________________________
    |_Command_Code_BYTE_M_|_A_|_STOP_|

First of all, through Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() routine, Master device generate an I2C start condition
with the Slave address and a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write.
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the Command code bytes through DMA.
When acknowledge is received on I2C3, DMA transfer the Command code data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register.
This will allow Master to transmit a byte to the Slave.
Each time a byte is received on I2C1 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs and byte is stored into an internal buffer
until a STOP condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received,
DMA transfer the next data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register until Transfer completed.
Master auto-generate a Stop condition when DMA transfer is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of reception on Slave side.
I2C1 IRQ handler and Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() routine are then clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED2 is On if data are well sent and the Command Code sent to slave is print in the Terminal I/O.

2- Request Command code :
    a. Type of command which need a specific data answer from Slave Device.
    b. I2C sequence is composed like that :
     _____________________________________________________________________________________
    |_START_|_Slave_Address_|_Wr_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_1_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_2_|_A_|....
     ______________________________________________________________________________
    |_Command_Code_BYTE_M_|_A_|_RESTART_|_Slave_Address_|_Rd_|_A_|_Data_BYTE_1_|_A_|...
     ___________________________________________
    |_Data_BYTE_2_|_A_|_Data_BYTE_N_|_NA_|_STOP_|

First of all, through Handle_I2C_Master_TransmitReceive() routine, Master device generate an I2C start condition
with the Slave address and a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write.
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the Command code bytes through DMA.
When acknowledge is received on I2C3, DMA transfer the Command code data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register.
This will allow Master to transmit a byte to the Slave.
Each time a byte is received on I2C1 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs and byte is stored into an internal buffer
until a RESTART condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received,
DMA transfer the next data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register until Transfer completed.
Then Master device generate a RESTART condition with Slave address and a read bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Read.
This will allow Slave to enter in transmitter mode and then send a byte when TXIS interrupt occurs.
When byte is received on I2C3, an RXNE event occurs and DMA transfer data from RXDR register to an internal buffer
until end of transfer.
Master auto-generate a NACK and STOP condition to inform the Slave that the transfer is finished.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of transmission on Slave side.
I2C1 IRQ handler and Handle_I2C_Master_TransmitReceive() routine are then clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED2 is On (500 ms) if data are well sent and the Command Code sent to slave is print as follow depending of IDE :
Note that
 - When resorting to EWARM IAR IDE:
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: View --> Terminal I/O

 - When resorting to MDK-ARM KEIL IDE:
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: View --> Serial Viewer --> Debug (printf) Viewer

- When resorting to AC6 SW4STM32 IDE:
 In Debug configuration window\ Startup, in addition to "monitor reset halt" add the command "monitor arm semihosting enable"
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: Window--> Show View--> Console.

After each use cases, the LED2 blinks quickly to wait for a new user-button press to send a new Command code to the Slave device.

In all cases, if an error occurs, LED2 is blinking slowly.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C1 SCL/SDA (PB.8 and PB.9)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C3 (PC.0 and PC.1).
      - I2C1_SCL  PB.8 (CN10, pin 3) : connected to I2C3_SCL PC.0 (CN7, pin 38) 
      - I2C1_SDA  PB.9 (CN10, pin 5) : connected to I2C3_SDA PC.1 (CN7, pin 36)

  - Launch the program in debug mode to benefit of Terminal I/O information. Press User push-button to initiate a write request by Master 
      then Slave receive bytes.

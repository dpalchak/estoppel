@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure OPAMP peripheral in standalone mode. The gain 
in this mode can be set externally (external gain setting mode). 

  
   OPAMP1 is configured as following:
   - Standalone mode (gain depends on external loads).
   - Non Inverting input is connected to DAC_OUT1 (sinevawe).
   - OPAMP Output is available on OPAMP1_VOUT (amplified sine wave signal).
   - Push the Key Push button to alternatively switch from
     normal power mode to low power mode.
   - In both normal or low power modes, the gain can be used adjusted thanks to RV2 
        potentiometer (from gain = 0 up to maximum - saturation may occurs).

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  
  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up
    
      - Make sure that LCD Glass is in position IO.
      - Make sure jumper in position on CN10.
      - Make sure jumper jumper JP10 is either in position 12 or 23.
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (DAC_OUT1, PA4: pin38  - connector CN7)
        (i.e. DAC output = OPAMP input).
      - Connect an oscilloscope to TP9 (PA3 can not be accessed easily) pin to display waveform 
        (OPAMP output)
      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

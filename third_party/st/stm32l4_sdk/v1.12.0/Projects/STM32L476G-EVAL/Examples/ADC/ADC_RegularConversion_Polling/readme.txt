@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC in Polling mode to convert data through the HAL API.

When the end of conversion occurs, the converted data of ADC1 DR register is 
affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

Note that the test carries out only one conversion. To trigger another conversion, the user
needs to reset then restart the example execution. 

Conversion time (reference manual, "Reset and clock control" and "ADC clocks" sections):
  1) the system clock is 80 MHz.
  2) __HAL_RCC_ADC_CONFIG() macro in HAL_ADC_MspInit() API sets the system clock as ADC asynchronous clock source 
  2) ClockPrescaler field of initialization structure is set to ADC_CLOCK_ASYNC_DIV1
     => the input ADC clock is set in asynchronous clock mode   
     => the input ADC clock is the undivided system clock 


  Sampling time is set to ADC_SAMPLETIME_6CYCLES_5 (6.5 cycles).
  ConvTime = Sampling time + 12.5 ADC clock cycles.
           = 19 clock cycles
           = (19 / 80 MHz) = 237.5 ns 
                     

User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_5 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer (RV3) connected to PA.00.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED1 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use two ADC peripherals to
perform conversions in interleaved dual-mode.

A compilation switch (located in main.h) is available to select ADC configuration
continuous mode and external trigger:
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_WITH_TIMER" defined: ADC is operating in not continuous mode
   and conversions are triggered by external trigger: timer.
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_WITH_TIMER" not defined: ADC is operating in continuous mode
   and first conversion is triggered by software trigger.

A compilation switch (located in main.h) is available to generate a waveform
voltage for test:
 - "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST" defined: waveform voltage for test is generated
   on DAC_CHANNEL_1 (output pin PA.04) by DAC peripheral.
   This voltage follows a 5-step curve, ADC sampling rate is set so that for a given
   ADC, two conversions are carried out for one DAC output level.
 - "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST" not defined: no voltage is generated, user has
   to connect a voltage source to the selected ADC channel input
   or resort to the Eval Board potentiometer (RV3) connected to PA.00 
   in order to make the ADC_CHANNEL_5 voltage vary.

Note: In this example, ADC sampling rate is not set as the highest possible (ADC parameters not set for this purpose: resolution 12 bits, ... ).
      ADC sampling rate can be increased by modifying resolution and sampling time, but this will decrease the conversion accuracy.

Other peripherals related to ADC are used:
Mandatory:
 - GPIO peripheral is used in analog mode to drive signal from device pin to
   ADC input.
Optionally:
 - Timer peripheral is used to trigger ADC conversions.
 - DMA peripheral is used to transfer ADC conversions data.
   Both ADC are using the same DMA (DMA of ADC master). DMA is used as well by DAC in case of WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST enabled. 

ADC conversion results:
 - ADC conversions results are transferred automatically by DMA, into variable
   array "aADCDualConvertedValues".
   ADC master and ADC slave results are concatenated in a common 32-bit data register:
   - ADC master results in the 16 LSB [15:0] (with ADC resolution 12 bits, bits effectively used are [11:0])
   - ADC slave results in the 16 MSB [31:16] (with ADC resolution 12 bits, bits effectively used are [27:16])


 - DMA are configured to operate continuously, in circular mode.
   Data is transferred by words every ADC1+ADC2 conversions.
   When DMA transfer half-buffer and complete buffer length are reached, callbacks 
   HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() and HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() are called.

 - In this example, dual conversion values are extracted from the common register and
   stored into 2 arrays corresponding to each ADC conversion values
   (aADCxConvertedValues, aADCyConvertedValues).


Board settings:
  ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert the same channel: ADC_CHANNEL_5 (pin PA.00).

  If compilation switch "WAVEFORM_VOLTAGE_GENERATION_FOR_TEST" is defined, the voltage input on ADC channel comes 
  from the DAC channel. This means that pins PA.00 and PA.04 must
  be connected by a wire. 

STM32L476G-EVAL board LEDs are used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED1 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion
   status:
    - Turned-off if ADC conversions have just filled up half of the buffer (DMA half-transfer interrupt has been triggered)
    - Turned-on if ADC conversions have filled up the complete buffer (DMA transfer complete interrupt has been triggered)
   The buffer fill up carries on indefinitively. 
 - Error: In case of error, LED3 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

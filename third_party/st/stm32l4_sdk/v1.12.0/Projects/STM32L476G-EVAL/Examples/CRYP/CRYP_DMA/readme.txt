@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYP peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using AES 128 Algorithm with ECB chaining mode in DMA mode.

DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the AES processor
input as well as to transfer data from AES processor output to memory.

64-byte buffers are ciphered and deciphered (4 AES blocks)
Ciphering/Deciphering with a 128-bit long key is used with data type set to 8-bit (byte swapping).

This example unrolls as follows: 
- AES Encryption (Plain Data --> Encrypted Data)
- AES Decryption with key derivation (Encrypted Data --> Decrypted Data)

When resorting to IAR Embedded Workbench IDE, plain data, encrypted and decrypted
data are displayed on debugger Terminal I/O as follows: View --> Terminal I/O.
When resorting to MDK-ARM KEIL IDE, plain data, encrypted data and decrypted 
data are displayed on debugger as follows:  View --> Serial Viewer --> Debug (printf) Viewer.
When resorting to ATOLLIC TrueSTUDIO IDE:  debug --> view--> others-->SWV console.
When resorting to AC6 SW4STM32 IDE:
 In Debug configuration window\ Startup, in addition to "monitor reset halt" add the command "monitor arm semihosting enable"
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: Window--> Show View--> Console.
 
When all ciphering and deciphering operations are successful, LED1 is turned on.
In case of ciphering or deciphering issue, LED3 is turned on. 


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32L486xx devices.
  
    - This example has been tested with a STM32L486ZG embedded on an 
    STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be easily tailored to any other supported 
    device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

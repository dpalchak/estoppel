@par Application Description 

This example describes how to use USB host application based on the Humain Interface Class (HID) on the STM32L4xx devices.

This example is part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware.

This is a typical example on how to use the STM32L4xx USB OTG Host peripheral to interact with an USB 
HID Device such as a Mouse or a Keyboard.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs (PLL or PLL SAI) or from MSI

When the application is started, the connected HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) is detected in HID mode and 
gets initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a HID Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 
This example is based on interacting with a HID device (Mouse/Keyboard) trough a HID routine.

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
 - "Start HID" operation starts the appropriate HID application to the attached HID Device.
   - "Start Mouse / Re-Initialize" operation starts Mouse HID example. Moving the mouse will move
    the pointer in the display rectangle and if a button is pressed, the corresponding rectangle will be
    highlighted in Blue.
   - "Start Keyboard / Clear" operation starts Keyboard HID example. Taped Keyboard characters are 
   displayed on the LCD screen.
 - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L476G-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that LCD Glass is in position IO
    - Plug the USB HID device into the STM32L476G-EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector CN1 (OTG-FS).
    - Make sure jumper JP1 is in connected in position 3V3 and JP19 is present.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

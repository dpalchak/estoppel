@par Application Description

This application provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module. The objective is to
develop an application that exploits the FatFs features to configure a microSD drive.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps:

 - Link the uSD disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the uSD drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the uSD disk I/O driver.

It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. Otherwise, user can check if the
written text file is available on the uSD card.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements.

It is possible to dynamically hot plug/unplug the uSD card, as the application will
handle the plug/unplug events.

@note: for some uSD's, replacing it  while the application is running makes the application
       fail. It is recommended to reset the board using the "Reset button" after replacing
       the uSD.


STM32L476G-EVAL's LED can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32L476xx devices

  - This application has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a uSD Card to the MSD connector (CN18).

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Insert a microSD card in the board appropriate slot
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application

@par Demo Description

The STM32Cube demonstration platform comes on top of the STM32Cube as a 
firmware package that offers a full set of software components based on a modular 
architecture. All modules can be reused separately in standalone applications. All
these modules are managed by the STM32Cube demonstration kernel that allows to 
dynamically add new modules and access common resources (storage, graphical components
and widgets, memory management, real-time operating system). The STM32Cube demonstration
platform is built around the FreeRTOS real-time operating system and uses almost all
STM32 features and offers a large scope of use cases based on the STM32Cube HAL BSP
and several middleware components.

A Binary file STM32CubeDemo_STM32L476G-Discovery-V1.0.5.hex is available in the 
"binary" directory. It can be downloaded using ST-Link Utility.
      
      
MENU NAVIGATION
========================================
Done with joystick keys:
- RIGHT & SEL:   launch application or enter in sub-menu 
                (SEL key is also used for Pause/Resume in Audio Playback application)
- LEFT:          exit application or back to upper menu level
- DOWN:          next menu item or down volume control in audio application
- UP:            previous menu item or volume up control in audio application 

LEDs
========================================
- LD5 is toggling during Audio record & playback applications else it remains OFF
- LD4 is set ON upon error detection

LOW POWER SCENARII
========================================
By default MCU goes into STOP2 mode after a period of inactivity:
- 10 seconds when running from USB ST-LINK
- 4 seconds when running from BATTERY (CR2032)
Use OPTION->LPMODE sub-menu to select alternative low power strategy:
- OFF (MCU keeps on running (only applicable when not running from battery))
Change in low power strategy applies upon selection and is saved in Backup area for 
next firmware demonstration start up or reset. 
Wake up is done upon any joystick key selection.

  - SHTDWN (shutdown: no RTC, no LSE, Flash ART off)  

 + RECORD
 --------------
 Audio record 16-bit at 48Khz. Recorded file stored in QuadSPI flash.

 + PLAYER
 --------------
 Audio playback of WAV format file from either:
 - internal FLASH (audio.bin provided under "Utilities/Media/Audio" is to be flashed 
   at @ 0x08020000 with ST-Link Utility V3.5.x)
 - recorded audio file from QuadSPI FLASH
 
 + COMPASS
 --------------
 Compass application using the ST Mems LSM303C mounted on the MB1184 board.
 A calibration phase is require at first run, please perform rotations in the 
 3 axis, then press LEFT/RIGHT/SEL key to stop the calibration.
 Calibration data are saved in backup area.

 + SOUND
 --------------
 Soundmeter application with Audio record 16-bit at 48Khz

 + GUITAR
 --------------
 Acoustic guitar tuner application from the thickest to the thinnest string, 
 respectively :
    “STR1”             String 1 (E or 6E or Mi grave (French))
    “STR2”             String 2 (A or 5A or La (French))
    “STR3”             String 3 (D or 4D or Ré (French))
    “STR4”             String 4 (G or 3G or Sol (French))
    “STR5”             String 5 (B or 2B or Si (French))
    “STR6”             String 6 (e or 1E or Mi aigu (French))
 Output:
    “    “ when recording sample is invalid (board needs to be closed enough to the guitar)
    “ OK “ when string is in tune
    “ ++ “ when string needs to be tightened
    “  + ” when string needs to be tightened but close to in tune
    “ -- “ when string is too tightened

For more details about the demonstration modules please refers to UM1919 "STM32CubeL4 demonstration
for 32L476GDISCOVERY discovery kit" User Manual.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.
 
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

For more details about FreeRTOS implementation on STM32Cube, please refer to UM1722 "Developing Applications 
on STM32Cube with RTOS".

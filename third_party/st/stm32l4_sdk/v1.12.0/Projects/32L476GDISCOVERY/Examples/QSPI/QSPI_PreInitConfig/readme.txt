@par Example Description

This example describes how to execute a part of the code from the QuadSPI Flash memory configured in 
memory-mapped mode before the call to main() function so that QuadSPI Flash memory is available after the reset.

The QSPI is configured in memory-mapped mode before to call main() function and QuadSPI Flash memory 
is then available after the reset. 

The configuration of the QSPI is done in the file system_stm32l4xx.c file in the 
function SystemInit_ExtMemCtl(). It is called by the function SystemInit(), which
is the first function called by the Reset_Handler.

The code in executed in a forever loop. It is the same code as GPIO_IOToggle example 
with some code mapped in QSPI mode and other in Flash, to show the jump from one 
memory to the other.

LED4 and LED5 toggle in this forever loop.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 80 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-Discovery board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L476G-Discovery Set-up :
    - Board is configured by default to access QuadSPI Flash memory

  - A specific region for the QuadSPI Flash memory has been added in the scatter file 
   (STM32L476xx_flash.icf for IAR toolchain, STM32L476G-Discovery.sct for Keil toolchain,
   STM32L476VGTx_FLASH.ld for SW4STM32 toolchain and STM32L476VG_FLASH.ld for TrueSTUDIO 
   toolchain) in order to map functions in this memory

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files 
 - Load your image into target memory with ST-Link Utility (v3.9.0 or later) and select 
   external loader N25Q128A_STM32L476G-DISCO
   -> !!! Be careful, don't try to use the toolchain to load the image, it is not able to load some code in QuadSPI Flash memory !!!
 - Run the example

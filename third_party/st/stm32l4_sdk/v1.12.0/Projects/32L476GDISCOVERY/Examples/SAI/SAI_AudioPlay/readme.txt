@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the SAI HAL API to play an audio file using the DMA 
circular mode and how to handle the buffer update.

      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 20%.
      The audio file is played in loop
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' (available in AudioFile) directly in the flash 
      at @0x08080000 using ST-Link utility

Once started, LED5 is toggling on STM32L476G-Discovery.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L476G-Discovery
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32L476G-Discovery Set-up :
    - Plug headset on AUDIO JACK connector.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
